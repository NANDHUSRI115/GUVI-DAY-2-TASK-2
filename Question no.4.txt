Question No.4
The typeof operator is used to get the data type of its operand

console.log(typeof(1)) 
It will take as integer value
The typeof operater is "number"

console.log(typeof(1.1)) 
It will take as integer value.if we use parseFloat it will take as floating point value
The typeof operator is "number"

console.log(typeof('1.1'))
Inside the “ ” or ‘ ‘ it take it as string value
The typeof operator is "string"

console.log(typeof(true))
The result is ‘Boolean’.it has true and false
The typeof operator is "boolean"

console.log(typeof(null))
Typeof null is an ‘object’ which gives a wrong impression that,
Null is an object where it is a primitive value.
The typeof operator is "object"

console.log(typeof(undefined))
)- a type check on an undeclared variable used to result in 'undefined'.
But this is not an error-safe way to deal with it
The typeof operator is "undefined"

console.log(typeof([]))
The result is ‘object’.it will take empty square bracket as object 
The typeof operator is "object"

console.log(typeof({}))
The result is ‘object’.it will take empty bracket as object
The typeof operator is "object"

console.log(typeof(NaN))
The typeof NaN is 'number'.
The typeof operator is "number"
